**Dino Library**

*(I changed the name of this program from Dinosaur Dic (dictionary) to Dino Library because one of my coworker said the name is little bit….hmm…)*

My 4-year-old son loves dinosaurs. His interest has consumed his small little stature. 
As his dad, I tell stories of the more well-known dinosaurs such as the T-Rex, Triceratops, and Stegosaurus that roamed the earth. But his delightful little mind yearns for more. It’s proving difficult to explain that daddy doesn’t know every dinosaur. If I had a dictionary or application for Dinosaurs, I can better explain and expand his mind of the numerous variety of dinosaurs that once existed.
That is where Dino-Library started from. 

This is a dictionary that we barely add or modify the list.
So, I use one of well-organized site ‘thoughtco.com’ and scraped its dinosaur page maintained by Bob Strauss(‘https://www.thoughtco.com/dinosaurs-a-to-z-1093748') and Wikipedia for more information.

This program has three functions.
1.	List all of dinosaurs in library
    a.	If you do not remember the dinosaur’s name even first letter, check all dinosaurs
2.  List dinosaurs starting with a letter
    a.	If you do not remember the dinosaurs name, but first letter, check this out
3.  Display a dinosaur with more information
    a.	Now you can see the dinosaur you are looking for


This program currently has only a few functions, but I will be able to add more functions or attributes if my son needs to know more.
