I am an IT helpdesk at work. I have experiences about servers, various of OS, network, printers, and etc.
If I want, I can work as an IT helpdesk until I retire. Then, why do I want to change my career to developer?

 First, IT helpdesk is handling too many fields like network, server, IT security, etc. Most of companies have a couple of engineers on each field. It means no one is able to be the expert of all fields. In other words, my skillsets are wide, but shallow. It is time to choose one and improve it.

 Second, salary is limited. IT helpdesk role can earn up to 70k -80k per year. It is huge money to IT helpdesk engineers, but it is not that high to developers. To live in NJ or NY, I hope to earn more money for a living.
 
 Third, I love suppoting people and I can work at night and on weekends as an IT helpdesk.  However, if I posses my own works and tried to do my best to complete my works, I think I will feel a sense of accomplishment in my work more than working as an IT helpdesk.

 In conclusion, I know I am comparibly old to become an developer and I know it is not be easy to get through working as an web developer, but I believe I can overcome all of difficulties becuase I am a diligent and passionate to learn new skills.
