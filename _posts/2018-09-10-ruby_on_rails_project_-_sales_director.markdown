Sales Director is an orders and sales management system built with Rails which utilizes ActiveRecord to maintain the database of company needs. I took a CSS template from W3.org site for better appearance. OmniAuth allows the users of this application to create user profiles or login through Google. Upon profile creation customers can create new orders and see orders they made and employees can add, edit, and delete orders, items, invoices and customer users.

It is second version of sales managing application I built.
I created one with Sinatra as a previous project and I wanted to enhance functions and performance. 
It was not easy and had a lot of time building this application.

I named Sales Director because previous one is Sales Manager, so I want to promote the title. Ha Ha.
I know t still requires a lot of refactors, more functions and modifications. But, I love what I have done and little proud of it.

During this session, I recognized that I need to have skills of Javascript in depth because Javascript can make my application much more powerful and looks awesome.  Good thing is I will learn Javascrip in next session, so I am looking forward to learing Javascript and making my application better.
